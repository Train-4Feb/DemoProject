Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project 
simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. 
It helps track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate efficiently. 
Git uses repositories to store the history of changes and branches to manage different lines of 
develop-ment. 
Popular commands include `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`.
